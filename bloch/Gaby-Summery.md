Chapter 4
The importance of a Historian view on his research, the importance of staying impartial, and factual. To force an opinion was in his eyes “un-tasteful” and no longer a historian. To avoid this he said to avoid personal terms such as “success” and “failure.” He ends this section stating “when all said and done a single word ‘understanding’ sheds light of our study (143).” 
Part 2: This is the section where he goes into a historians mindset as he is going through documents. He says that a historian with a impartial mind set should be sorting and, seeking out similarities and comparing them. He tells them to ignore rationality and focus on the raw material. He warns in this section that it is only human to place a modern mind set or assumptions in the texts, he warns that this draws attention away from the raw material. To be aware of false science, nature, and man; and to use the scientific method to differentiate those aspects of rationality. You do this by moving from individual and society and its characteristic mental attitudes. “A historian never escapes time (156).”
Nomenclature: A historian should be placing himself in the time period looking at the raw material realizing every small aspect of them and not just the main one. he says to place themselves and look at every days life, he goes into depth into the political motivations that can shape documents in a social sense, and language differences that could influence individual lives. 
Language: is a topic he spent a lot of time on, and the dangers that come along with it as a historian. Bilingualism, vocabulary, class, generation and translation are all things that can make a historians work more difficult. He says to be careful to define things but it has to be done. 
Chapter 5 Causation
Causation is one of the more difficult things to keep an impartial mind with. As historians we can not escape “why” and “because” we classify causes, but it is hard to reach fact of causation because of conditions. We need to use reason when we read, and not assume fact (194). We can only argue using, condition, sensitive attitudes, and “pseudo geographical determinism.” There are many factors that play a role in. Just like the scientific method we need to form a hypothesis and then test it using raw material; in an impartial, and rational mind set.
